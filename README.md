Heat CI/CD Templates
====================

This is a repository for Heat templates that Rackspace runs against
our Heat CI environment.

Pull Requests
=============

Pull requests are greatly appreciated.  However, please only make PULL
requests against the DEV folder. The reason for this is we need to
validate templates for our CI environment.
