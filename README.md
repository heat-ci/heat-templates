Heat CI/CD Templates
======================

This is an internal repository for example Heat templates that Rackspace runs against our Heat CI enviornment. There is little to no structure now, but this should change in the future.

Pull Requests
======================
Pull requests are greatly appreciated.  However, please only make PULL requests against the DEV folder. The reason for this is we need to validate templates for our CI environment, and we don't always run all templates gainst every one of our CI enviornments.
